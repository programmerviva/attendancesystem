## Logic Overview

### 1. **Authentication Logic**
   - **Login**: Validate user credentials against the database.
   - **Registration**: Hash passwords using bcrypt before storing them.
   - **Session Management**: Use JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure and stateless session handling.

### 2. **Attendance Marking**
   - Employees mark attendance by clicking a button on the dashboard.
   - System records the timestamp and validates it against working hours.
   - Late arrivals or early departures are flagged for admin review.

### 3. **Admin Controls**
   - Admins can:
     - View all employee attendance records in a tabular format.
     - Edit incorrect entries or add missing attendance records.
     - Generate reports for specific employees or departments.

### 4. **Notification System**
   - Use WebSocket or push notifications to send real-time updates to users.
   - Notifications include reminders for marking attendance and alerts for irregularities.

### 5. **Data Flow**
   - **Frontend**: Sends requests to the backend via REST APIs.
   - **Backend**: Processes requests, interacts with the database, and sends responses.
   - **Database**: Stores user, attendance, and activity data.
