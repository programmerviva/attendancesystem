# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.



Now that the employee login is working, you could:

Test the complete workflow - Create employees, have them log in, mark attendance, request leave, etc.

Add more features to your attendance system:

Implement the leave approval process for admins

Add reporting features to track attendance statistics

Create a dashboard for employees to view their attendance history

Improve the UI/UX of your application:

Add loading states during API calls

Implement better error handling and user feedback

Make the interface more responsive for mobile devices

Add security enhancements:

Implement password reset functionality

Add account lockout after failed login attempts

Set up proper session management

Deploy your application to a production environment if you're ready to go live.
